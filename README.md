Check out generate_compatibility_graph.py for an example of how to generate the compatibility graph. Here, we assume not only blood type compatiblity but also tissue type compatiblity (with a PRA test - a donor must have a higher virtual PRA than the patient's PRA to be compatible, see https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/papers/MS-kidney_exchange.pdf). Check out patient_donor_pairs.py for helpful functions/classes.
